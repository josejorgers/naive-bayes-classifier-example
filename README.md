Example of a simple implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier along with a practical exercise in which I determine whether a given Titanic's passenger survived to the tragedy or not.

## Requirements

This is a jupyter notebook so you'll need Jupyter Notebook to run the example. I use pandas to read and process the data. There're no other requirements.
