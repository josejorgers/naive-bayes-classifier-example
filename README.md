# Naive Bayes Classifier Example

Example of a simple implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier along with a practical exercise in which I determine whether a given passenger on the Titanic survived to the tragedy or not.

## Requirements

This is a jupyter notebook therefore you'll need to install Jupyter Notebook to run the example. I use pandas to read and process the data. There are no other requirements.
